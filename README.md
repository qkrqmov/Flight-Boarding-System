# Flight-Boarding-System

Flight Boarding System using VB.NET. The project was made for my course.
The program records all the necessary information for the seats on the flight. 

#Getting started

The software allows for booking seats as well as cancelling the seats. There are different tiers of seats each allowing more options to be selected.

The program inputs:
* The name of the customer
* The flight reference number and destination
* The seat name
* The Meal selection
* If they booked a bed or not

There is an executable file in the root folder which will open the application and is the only file necessary for the program to run. There is also a PDF that has a user guide on how to use the application and it's different parts.
